Introduction / Business Problem

In my final work here at Data Science Capstone I will discuss
the similarities between two great cities: Berlin/Germany and New York City/USA

These two cities are the financial center of its continents.

I'm going to show the number of venues, what are the most 
common types of venues, how they are close each other as well
as show a map comparing the density of business in the central
area of each town. That, together with number of people living in each, could
help stackeholders discover where there's space for new business and where not.
